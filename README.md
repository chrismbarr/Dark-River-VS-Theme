# Dark Visual Studio Theme
A dark code scheme for Visual Studio 2012

--------

## Step 1 (optional)
This theme makes use of the DejaVu Sans Mono font, but any font can be used. 
If you want to use Deja Vu Sans Mono it can be downloaded here: http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page

## Step 2 (optional)
Before using this theme, first see if you want to install any of the following Visual Studio exentions.
These need to be installed *before* importing the theme.  If you install any of these after the theme has been imported you will need to re-import the theme.

This theme has syntax/coloring support for the following extentions:

* [ReSharper 7.x](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper)
* [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com)
* [Mindscape Web Workbench](http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench)
* [VS Color Output](http://mike-ward.net/vscoloroutput)
* [Indent Guides](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e792686d-542b-474a-8c55-630980e72c30)
* [Spell Checker](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/86788d02-ce1e-4933-b499-cdba6a70f26f)


## Step 3
Select the environment theme you want to use in the Visual Studio options.
We recommend the dark theme.
To select the environment theme click the **Tools** menu, select **Options** and then go to **Environment** > **General** and choose an option from the **Color Theme** dropdown.


## Step 4
Import the theme!

1. In Visual Studio go to the **Tools** menu and select **Import & Export Settings**
2. Choose **Import selected environment settings** and press **Next**
3. You don't have to back up your current settings, but you can if you want to. Otherwise just choose the last options to overwrite your current settings.
4. **Browse** to the downloaded file then press **Next**
5. It will ask you which settings you want to import, you can just go ahead and press the **Finish** button though since the theme file *only* includes settings for fonts & colors

## Step 5 (optional)
If you have ReSharper more syntax coloring support can be added by clicking the **ReSharper** menu > **Options** > **Code Inspection** > **Settings** > and check **Color Identifiers**

# Here's what the theme looks like!
**NOTE:** Unfortunatly these images do not fully represent what the theme looks like.
The background color is actually more of a dark grey, and these seem to show it as black.
